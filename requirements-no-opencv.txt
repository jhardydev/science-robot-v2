# Requirements file without opencv-python
# Use this on ARM64 systems where opencv-python should be installed via apt-get
# Install opencv via: sudo apt-get install python3-opencv

# MediaPipe Gesture Recognizer Tasks API requires MediaPipe 0.10.8 or later
# Version 0.10.0 is too old and causes "C2__PACKET" errors
# Note: ARM64 Linux may not have pre-built wheels - may need to build from source
mediapipe>=0.10.8
numpy>=1.24.0
flask>=2.0.0
psutil>=5.9.0  # For process management and robot control

# ROS dependencies (install via apt-get, not pip):
# Ubuntu 22.04 uses ROS Noetic:
# sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-rospy ros-noetic-duckietown-msgs ros-noetic-cv-bridge ros-noetic-sensor-msgs ros-noetic-std-msgs ros-noetic-catkin python3-catkin-tools python3-rospkg python3-opencv libopencv-dev

# NVIDIA libraries (typically included with JetPack/Duckietown containers):
# VPI - Vision Programming Interface (system library)
# TensorRT - Deep learning inference (system library)
